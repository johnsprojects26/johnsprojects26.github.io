<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BIOGRAPHY<br /></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">I started work on this album in september 2025 shortly after the release of <em>release this when im dead</em> that previous month.<br />This album shifted towards having more centric unified overarching concept. The concept in question was influenced by personal<br />tribulations I had dealt with, recent and old.&nbsp;A lot&nbsp;of death happened in my life at this time, most notably the death of my grandparents.<br />In 2024, my grandmother tragically passed away, then shortly after my grandfather began his battle with cancer, to which he would<br />eventually&nbsp;capitulate to around the time I was writing this album. I found their whole story captivating, two people who loved each other<br />so dearly both dying within such a short time span... it's truly remarkable, it's as if it were destined. Another influencing factor this album<br />would be the persistent fear of death I have experienced throughout my whole life. I recall being very young, no older than 3, asking my mother<br />something along the lines of "what happens after we die?" She replied with something along the lines of "we go to heaven honey". That was a<br />good enough answer for me until age 10. I'm not sure what happened, but one day I questioned it all. Long story short I became atheist.<br />Now having a lack in belief of a higher power of god, I was left with the terrifying fact that when we die we cease to exist. Being so young,<br />I couldn't possibly have navigated through these thoughts, so I sat in extreme persistent denial until eventually resubscribing to religion.<br />Religion simply was not for me. Throughout being a teenage, stereotypical things have occurred with me that have occurred with many<br />other teenagers... I began to question things. A lot of things. I went from following the American right wing political ideologies of my parents to&nbsp;<br />more non conformist and progressive views. This set up the ground work for me to requestion religion. It took a long time. Undoing denial.<br />This album is a representation of acknowledgment and the acceptance of everything finite.<br />To put this whole album's concept into simple terms, it's about the persistent denial of death in our society.<br /><br />As for the sound of this album, the recording process was very similar to the last. I used my iPhone microphone to record essentially everything.<br />I primarily used the Greek Bouzouki on this album, as oppose to using an electric guitar. I still wanted to maintain a distorted noisy sound,<br />so this album leaned&nbsp;<em>a ton&nbsp;</em>into electroacoustic. This album also leans more into drone.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"The nearly whispered words come across like the final page of a </em><br /><em>diary entry of someone who is living at the end of the world and regrets not having </em><br /><em>more time with their loved one and how cruel that that connection had to </em><br /><em>happen right when there is no escaping the eschatological disaster."<br />- <a href="https://queencitysounds.org/2026/01/01/i-will-eternally-miss-you-when-the-abyss-finally-disintegrates-me-by-the-fear-of-death-and-the-end-of-time-is-a-gutting-depiction-of-the-last-days-of-humanity/">Queen City Sounds</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&nbsp;"The sounds that make me question my place in the world the more I sink into them. </em><br /><em>was I really put on here to do great things?, to consume the same media and foods as everyone else, </em><br /><em>or was I put here to relay a message that you did a good job. </em><br /><em>The ability to do much with little is your strength."</em><br /><em>- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXg_ofkzsjs&amp;lc=Ugxug5JBzk5Ob0OLGm94AaABAg">YouTube Commenter</a></em></p>
